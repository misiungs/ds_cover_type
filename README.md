This repository is about multivariate classification with use of a neural network. The main goal is to find optimal neural network parameters to obtain best possible accuracy.  
Classification problem is about predicting forest cover type based on cartographic variables only. In total 12 features (54 after one hot encoding) is used to categorize cover into one of 7 classes.  
The data set is available under repository:

It has been used in publications:
